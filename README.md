## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to work with simple APIs.

API fetching inside async functions. And writing response to JSON.

```js
async function request() {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.adviceslip.com/advice");
  const data = await response.json();
}
```

Reading data from JSON objects.

```js
async function request() {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.adviceslip.com/advice");
  const data = await response.json();

  retrieved_id = data.slip.id;
  retrieved_advice = data.slip.advice;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to train my skill in working with different usefull APIs. I'm just not yet as familiar with this theme as i should, so i work hard to be more proficient.

### Useful resources
